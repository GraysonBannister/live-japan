# 2026-02-28 - Live Japan Session

## Time
Saturday, February 28th, 2026 — 6:05 AM (Asia/Tokyo)

## Task Completed

### Fixed: Cron Job LaunchAgent Exit Code 127 (Recurring Issue)
- **Problem**: LaunchAgent `com.live-japan.ingest` showing exit code 127 again
- **Root Cause**: Stale/cached LaunchAgent reference
- **Solution**: Removed and reloaded the LaunchAgent:
  ```bash
  launchctl remove com.live-japan.ingest
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.live-japan.ingest.plist
  ```
- **Verification**: `launchctl list | grep live-japan` now shows exit code 0

### Current State
- LaunchAgent properly loaded with exit code 0
- Scheduled to run daily at 3:00 AM JST
- Script path: `/Users/graysonbannister/Documents/live-japan/scripts/cron-ingest.sh`
- Log file: `/Users/graysonbannister/Documents/live-japan/cron-ingest.log`

## Commit Hash
TBD - LaunchAgent fix didn't require file changes (was launchctl state issue)
