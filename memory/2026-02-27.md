# 2026-02-27 - Live Japan Session

## Time
Friday, February 27th, 2026 — 6:04 AM (Asia/Tokyo)

## Task Completed

### Fixed: Cron Job LaunchAgent (Exit Code 127)
- **Problem**: LaunchAgent `com.live-japan.ingest` was showing exit code 127 (command not found)
- **Root Cause**: LaunchAgent was cached/stale and needed reload
- **Solution**: Unloaded and reloaded the LaunchAgent:
  ```bash
  launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.live-japan.ingest.plist
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.live-japan.ingest.plist
  ```
- **Verification**: `launchctl list | grep live-japan` now shows exit code 0

### Current State
- LaunchAgent properly configured to run daily at 3:00 AM JST
- Script path: `/Users/graysonbannister/Documents/live-japan/scripts/cron-ingest.sh`
- Log file: `/Users/graysonbannister/Documents/live-japan/cron-ingest.log`
- Git repo clean, no uncommitted changes

### Separate Issue Noted
Scraper is experiencing browser automation issues (detached frame errors) when running `npm run ingest`. This is a Puppeteer/Playwright issue, not related to the cron job infrastructure fix.

## Commit Hash
TBD - LaunchAgent fix didn't require file changes (was launchctl state issue)
